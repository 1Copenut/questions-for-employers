# Questions for potential employers

This is a big collection of questions I've gathered over the years that have proven useful. In particular, they can really help you when you're trying to get a better sense of what your potential employer is all about before you say "yes" to them. 
Remember, in any interview you're trying to get to know them as much as they're trying to get to know you. Maybe more.

You wouldn't ask anyone all of these questions. Some of them are simple mechanics. Some of them help you when you've already got a whiff of org smells. 
Most all of them are handy to have in your pocket. Usually, after you've read the role description and had a phone screen you should have a pretty good idea of which questions to highlight.

I've broken them out by subject matter, with some notes on things to look for and avoid.

And if you'd like more questions for director-and-above positions, [Jacobian has a great list](https://jacobian.org/2019/apr/23/questions-for-employers-director-vp/).

## Getting started

**What's the onboarding process like?**
Do they have one? How well-defined is it? Do they have an "buddy system" or other mechanisms to help you get ramped up, or do they just let you sink or swim?

**Is this a new position or replacing a former employee?** This can be useful to understand how well-defined the position is and if it's a position set up for success.

Follow-ups: 
* If this is a replacement position, what happened to the former employee? How long were they in the role? 
* If it's a new position, what is the support level? What does success look like?

**In the first 60 to 90 days of employment, what would be my most urgent priorities?** Helpful for getting past the position description to the real expectations of the work. Plus [the first 90 days are critical](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/ninety-days/).

**What is the one thing I cannot fail at the first year?** Similar to the above question, this helps you get a sense of what your success criteria would be as well as how well the employer has defined the role. If they don't have clear answers to either of these, the role is probably poorly defined and not set up for success.

**What are the key accomplishments you’d like to see in this role over the next year?** This one's pretty much the inverse of the prior, but can be useful to compare and contrast responses.

**Who would I directly report to?** Honestly, I'm not sure this one is valuable unless you plan to internet-stalk your future boss. But I keep it because it can, in some cases, help you get a better sense of the org chart and where you'd be on it.


## Culture
**What type of people are successful here? What type of people are not?** Pay close attention to this one. You can potentially pick up a lot of red flags for homogenous, non-inclusive, bro-type cultures. The phrase "culture fit" could be a warning sign.

**How do you determine if someone is a poor fit for the company?** Same as above, they may tell you more than they mean to about what they value (and what they don't).

**If an employee does something harmful that isn't a fireable offense, how do you handle that? What steps do you take to create a culture of accountability?** They absolutely should have a plan for this. If they don't, any number of toxic-but-not-fireable behaviors are not being addressed.

**Is there any sort of institutionalized way of dealing with plateauing or preventing burnout?** You should hear something about rotation of duties or location, sabbaticals, etc. In other words, a real plan for avoiding burnout, not empty platitudes.

**How does internal communication work?** This can be a *really* telling question.

**Is it easy to move to other divisions or offices?** Warning: the interviewer could infer that you are a difficult teammate and like to jump around.

**Are there catered suppers?** This sounds good. It's not. In any properly functioning organization, you should be home for supper.

**How many hours a week does senior management work?** Do they put in 80-hour weeks? If so, run away.

**What is the company’s policy on work/life balance?** How does that work out in practice?

**How much vacation do people get?** If there's "unlimited" vacation, how much vacation do people normally take?

**Do people work on the weekend?**

**Do people check in when they're on vacation?**

**What is your remote work policy?** *Why* is that your remote work policy?

**Does this position require travel? How often?** 

**Is it possible to take sabbaticals or unpaid vacation?**

**How many hours do people work in an average week?** Because seriously, if the job can't be done in 40 hours, something is probably wrong.

**What is the policy on alternate work schedules?** Is variablity okay, or is everyone expected to be on the same schedule? In modern orgs, especially distributed orgs, asking everyone to punch the clock at the same time is backwards, at best.

**What time do people normally leave work? What time do they normally start?**

**Would I need to be on call? How often?**

**How often are there emergencies or times when people have to work extra hours?** Should be near zero. If not, it's probably a sign of either faulty DevOps or faulty management.

**What is your turnover rate?** How many devs were hired last year and how many left? Over the past 2-3 years? What are you doing to improve retention.

**Are the company’s managers inclined to call employees at home with questions or comments?** If so, that's bad. Doubly so if they'll call at night or weekends? 

**How many layers of company managers or executives does one have to go through to get approval for a new idea?**



## Understanding the company and team

**How are your teams structured? What is the management structure like? How do the two usually interact?**

**What’s the biggest challenge the team has gone through in the last year? Does the team currently feel optimistic about what's next?** Useful for getting a sense of team morale and working conditions.

**How does the organization reward employees?** Is it a star system / team-oriented / equity-based / bonus-based / golf-clap-based? Does it reward individual performance? Team performance? Is the reward tangible and real? How does the company demonstrate to an employee that they are an asset to the company?

Follow-ups: 
* Why is that your reward system? 
* If you could change any one thing about it, what would it be?

**Which competitor has you most worried?** 

**What’s one thing that’s key to this company’s success that somebody from outside the company wouldn’t know about?**

**What would you say are the company’s strengths?** Alternately, what would you say are the company’s weaknesses? It can be illuminating to flip these traditional interview questions back on the company.

**What is the company’s current strategy for generating new business? What is the company’s strategy for maintaining existing business?** This speaks to the viability of the business model and is particularly useful for startups.

**Are you profitable? if not, how does this affect what you can do? What's your planned timeline for becoming profitable?** Again, particularly useful for startups. Don't ask a publicly traded company this. It will just show you didn't do any research on readily available information.

**How do you make money?** Again, mostly for startups, but can they explain the business model in a way that makes sense?

**Are company financials, minus salaries, transparent throughout the company?**

**How much are you planning to hire in the next year?** If it's a large number, ask the follow-up: How do you plan to hire and onboard that many people?

**How does the company usually solve problems: through committee, group meetings, individual meetings or management only?** Helps get a sense of where they're at on the consensus-driven to top-down continuum.

**How are important decisions made and communicated?**  Are they dictated top down? Are ideas from anyone welcomed? If so, in what scope/context?



## Doing the work

**How does work get assigned?**

**How often do inexperienced people get to work directly with more experienced people?** And how so? Pairing, or something else? How does it work?

**How do you balance support and feature development?**

**Tell me about your cross-functional teams** Do they have dedicated designers? Product owners? QA? Technical writer? Dev manager? How cross-functional teams are built tells you a lot about what the company values enough to put on the team.

**How often do you have meetings? Are there scheduled/standing meetings? How much time should I expect to be in meetings** Remember, though, that for some positions (especially senior positions) meetings are a core component of the job.



Career development
Are employees encouraged to go speak at conferences? Do you cover travel to conferences?
