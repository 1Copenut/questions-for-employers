# Questions for potential employers

This is a collection of questions I've gathered over the years that can help you get a better sense of what your potential employer is all about before you say "yes" to them. 
Remember, in any interview you're trying to get to know them as much as they're trying to get to know you. Maybe more.

You wouldn't ask anyone all of these questions. Some of them are simple mechanics. Some of them help you when you've already got a whiff of org smells. 
Most all of them are handy to have in your pocket. I've broken them out by subject matter, with some notes on things to look for and avoid.

And if you'd like more questions for director-and-above positions, [Jacobian has a great list](https://jacobian.org/2019/apr/23/questions-for-employers-director-vp/)

## Understanding the position

**What's the onboarding process like?**
Do they have one? How well-defined is it? Do they have an "buddy system" or other mechanisms to help you get ramped up, or do they just let you sink or swim?

**Is this a new position or replacing a former employee?**
Can be useful to understand how well-defined the position is and if it's a position set up for success.

Follow-ups: 
* If this is a replacement position, what happened to the former employee? How long were they in the role? 
* If it's a new position, what is the support level? What does success look like?

**In the first 60 to 90 days of employment, what would be my most urgent priorities?**

**What is the one thing I cannot fail at the first year?**

7. If I get the job, how do I earn a “gold star” on my performance review? What are the key accomplishments you’d like to see in this role over the next year?

To whom would I directly report to?
